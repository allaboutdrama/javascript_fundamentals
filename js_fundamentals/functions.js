// Exercises: Functions

// EXERCISE: The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Write a function named tellFortune that:
// takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
// Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

function tellFortune(numChildren, partnerName, location, jobTitle) {
  alert("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + location + ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numChildren + " kids.");
}

tellFortune(6, "mama thornton", "toronto", "ceo");
tellFortune(3, "Nikka Costa", "Katmandu", "coder");
tellFortune(2, "George Burgess", "Lesotho", "Rugby Player");


// EXERCISE: The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

// Write a function named calculateAge that:
// takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
// calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
// outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
// Call the function three times with different sets of values.
// Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

var today = new Date();
var currentYear = today.getFullYear();
// console.log(birthYear);

function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear) {
  console.log("Your current age is " + (currentYear - birthYear))
 }

calculateAge(1965, currentYear)
calculateAge(1990, currentYear)
calculateAge(793, currentYear)

// EXERCISE: The Lifetime Supply Calculator

// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

// Write a function named calculateSupply that:
// takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
// calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
// outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
// Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
// Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

var MAX_AGE = 80;
  
function calculateSupply(age, dailyAmount) {
  var futureAmountConsumed = (MAX_AGE - age) * 365 * dailyAmount;
  console.log("You will need " + futureAmountConsumed + " grams of crack to last you until the ripe old age of " + MAX_AGE);
}

calculateSupply(25, 20)
calculateSupply(79, 15)




// EXERCISE: The Geometrizer

// Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

// Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

// Pass the radius to the function.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Create a function called calcArea:

// Pass the radius to the function.
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

// EXERCISE: The Temperature Converter

// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
